She and my dad are headed to England this fall. She goes by \"Grandma\" My mother-in-law: loves fancy things and does ballroom dancing as a hobby (at age 70!). Just bought a new home. Enjoys sentimental things and photos of her family and grandkids. Still working hard as an accountant of her own firm (was the first black female CPA in the state of Nebraska back in the 80s!) and lives in Los Angeles. We call her \"Papa Grandma\" or \"Grandma Hustle\" My neighbor: is kind of like a surrogate mom to us and grandma \"Nana Eva\" to our kids. Would love to get her something thoughtful that shows how much we love her. She enjoys high quality things (has gifted us a very nice olive oil, french milled lavender soap, a beautiful potted plant).",

      "question": "Hello, I just started exclusively dating this girl and even though we have only seen each other 3 times she has already given me a few gifts ($30 wine, cookies/snacks). I could use some help thinking of gifts for her. I am jewish and from Miami so I am thinking of giving her some chocolate matzah and ordering a Cuban pastry before our next date on Saturday so she can experience some of the things in my background, but I would like to give her something that doesn't cost under $10. We are in LA and she is from China (I believe came to the US 3 years ago). She likes podcasts, reading, museums, volunteering, photography, hiking, nature, traveling, snowboarding. She is currently reading the Percy Jackson series. My buddy gave me the idea of getting her a fancy candle but I read there might be some Chinese superstition behind that making it possibly a dicey idea. What are some other ideas that might be good? Forgot to mention I thought about getting her flowers since her name is a flower but she mentioned not liking flowers as a gift because she would rather they just stay alive.",
